## Description
This is a Quote app i created as a part of my assignment at moringa school.
This Quote project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.
### The Quote app.
Basically the app allows the user to post quotes by various people by their various categories eg religion or technology then after submiting over the form, other users can vote these quotes.This app uses a custom directive to highlight the most upvoted quote and also ranks it at position one in the list of othe quotes, the app also has two custom pipes that allows the user to see the timestamp for each quotes and also for pluralizing the words e.g  

## Technologies used.
Angular cli was used alongside bootstrap and css to develop the Quote application.
Git is used on the other side as the version control for tracking changes on the local and remote repository.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Procedure for the application development
+ Creatxz ing the project using *ng new Quote* to initialize the angular App
+ Creating a new component using *ng g c quote* for example
+ creating a models class to instantiate new quote instances.
+ creating a custom directive for highlighting quotes with highest votes
+ creating two custom pipes, one to show a time stamp from the time the vote was posted and another one to pluralize the upvote *eg. 1 upvote and 2 upvotes* for example
+ using build in directives to iterate over the data.
+ Deployment of the project to github and hosting on gh-pages
